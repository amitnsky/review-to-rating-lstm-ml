finally seeing results all movies have been pointing to and it did not disappoint thanos complex villain with deeper and more interesting desires than just world domination dilemmas all characters face this movie both heroes and villains are truly thought provoking and leave on edge seat no other set movies has beeen so involved so expanded and encompassed so many story linescharacters and previous movies sheer amount star power alone this film insane and they do masterful job weaving all these unique and various characters into common storyline', 'over past decade marvel has earned itself benefit doubt studio has consistently delivered smart funny brave films that both embrace and transcend their comicbook origins 18 blockbuster movies produced since iron man first blasted off into stratosphere 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as genre theyve helped to legitimise it indeed marvels two most recent films thor ragnarok and black panther have received kind accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks and yet its perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about avengers infinity war this blockbuster film thats been ten years making its plot hinted and scattered throughout 18 other movies it features 30 or so characters each with their own complex backstories and motivations and all them are coming together bid to stop giant purple alien dude from destroying universe it sounds ridiculous and feels impossible but thats precisely what makes final product such monumental achievement masterfully directed by anthony and joe russo infinity war bold brainy filmmaking its very best kind that will lift spirits blow mind and shatter soul occasionally same scene it demonstrates on an epic scale what marvel has known all along that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve story for all its blockbuster spectacle and theres almost too much that film works because its anchored by heart humour and humanity its charactersthe films basic plot simple thanos played via motioncapture by josh brolin intergalactic purveyor death and destruction has long been on hunt for six infinity stones that will give complete control over elemental building blocks universe he dispatches acolytes to earth to retrieve time stone currently possession dr stephen strange benedict cumberbatch and carve mind stone out forehead vision paul bettany its literal existential threat so terrifying that all heroes weve come to know and love from avengers to guardians galaxy must put aside their differences and unite against common foe from outset its immediately clear that neither films directors nor screenwriters christopher markus and stephen mcfeely are interested playing it safe most other superhero films are bled high stakes hero title might suffer untold trauma but its supersafe bet that he or she will make it to end alive theres no such guarantee here within first ten minutes are confronted with dark twisted depths to which thanos and acolytes black order will sink order to achieve their goals death as well as genuine loss and sacrifice intrinsic to narrative drumbeat that drives infinity war ever forward and film all better for it thats not to say movie morbid and depressing experience whats so impressive about infinity war how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods when its funny and it very often its deeply truly funny film finds maximum joy flinging characters together with merry abandon mixing and matching ones youd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter peter quill chris pratt floored by thors chris hemsworth godly muscles bruce banner mark ruffalo charmed by wit and intelligence shuri letitia wright and itd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by peter dinklages inspired cameo its blithely tongueincheek sensibility shared by marvels best comic books which understand that humour can make care when it really countsand boy does infinity war make it count there are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout film from charming surrogate fatherson dynamic shared by tony stark robert downey jr and peter parker tom holland to undeniable love that ties vision and wanda maximoff elizabeth olsen together many ways film stands as testament to human capacity not just to love but to love fiercely and beyond all logic its right there when unfailingly noble steve rogers chris evans declares dont trade lives even when giving up one could save billions theres even chilling echo it thanos himself lesser film would have turned thanos into onedimensional villain much way hes all monster and maniac comic books infinity war however thanos end goal surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about staggeringly overpopulated world which live today there as it turns out method to thanos madness it makes tragic twists and turns relationships with estranged adopted daughters gamora zoe saldana and nebula karen gillan all more unsettling for most part infinity war does justice too to many heroes who have been assembled for film russo brothers displayed great skill interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories captain america civil war and they do so again here with twice as many characters even most minor supporting players like don cheadles james rhodeswar machine are given story beats that land it helps that marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight even so there are few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast emotionally speaking this downeys film he plays every note tonys reluctant courage and bonedeep trauma as he embarks on what hes convinced suicide mission hes ably matched by cumberbatch who finds vulnerability even characters most cunning and calculative move hemsworth meanwhile given free rein to import bighearted comedic swagger thor ragnarok into this film while also layering it with deeplyfelt jagged grief for losses he has suffered hands thanos and universein film with so many moving parts some elements dont work quite as well couple characters that might have expected to be right forefront including an original avenger or two fade into background film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene and while most them are fantastically choreographed there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent thanos from clenching fist effect this superhero mêlée thats part overthetop and part overkill and might prove too much for those who dont already care for this franchise and characters itminor quibbles aside though infinity war yet another step right direction for marvel it continues studios tradition placing premium on rich complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences but it also refuses to make things easy for itself film ends even more bravely than it began with final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify equal measure its stroke bold brilliant genius narrative risk so audacious that youll want to follow marvel wherever it goes next', 'summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like epic spectacle and smash as ways to build hype to increase advanced box office sales summer 2018 film season kicks off big way with avengers infinity war and it rare summer film that exceeds lofty expectations and delivers crowning achievement for marvel cinematic universe when thanos josh brolin embarks on deadly campaign to find and possess infinity stones he leaves path death and destruction path when pursuit leading to earth bruce banner mark ruffalo and doctor strange benedict cumberbatch who enlist reluctant tony stark robert downey jr to cause just as minions thanos arrive with avengers fractured and scattered following events captain america civil war teams find themselves dealing with threat various groups as fate steps to divide many key members team this allows for great entry by guardians galaxy and allows film to take very enjoyable path essentially movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic have story with guardians as well as one with many key avengers as well as others with characters old and new as such it like guardians avengers and marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports other very well yet has charm and identity would expect while tone very dark as would expect with literally half known universe facing destruction there also some solid humor film that never once undermines story or pacing naturally effects are stunning as would expect as marvel has put significant amount money into film and it shows every eyepopping action sequence what really impressed most that russo brothers never let fx film overshadow characters and with very large cast it nice to see everyone got their moment and did not see members cast trying to one up each other there are some real surprise moments along way and action easily best any marvel film to date many fans had expressed disappointment with avengers age ultron for this film significantly better than prior film and everything that marvel fan would want film also surprised by how well thanos portrayed as while hopefully will not agree with deductions and methods could actually understand motivations and it help transcend from usual megalomaniacs which are so common films type really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure stay through credits for bonus scene believe hype avengers infinity war an epic not to be missed and an example what summer event film should be 5 stars out 5', 'amazed to see so many negative reviews so many people are impossible to please this movie 2 12 hours long but could have sat there another 2 12 hours and not noticed thoroughly entertaining and love how directors werent afraid to take chances ive read lot other user reviews that claim that theres no plot unless youre mentally handicapped or not paying attention because youre on phone entire movie plot pretty clear and decent my opinion', 'infinity war astonishing film which serves as culmination everything that occurred mcu since first pictures would seem movie had to turn out obscure and overloaded but screenwriters so skillfully bring one moment to another that movie bewitches with first until last minute war connects those who didnt know about existence each other divides teams which developed past transfers characters from one region galaxy another accompanying everything with grandiose battles same time narration remains clear and fascinating course if youve watched previous movies its not movie for those who want to get acquainted with captain america thor hulk and other famous characters film shot for fans and better know mcu story derive bigger pleasure from viewing']\n","\n","['this', 'movie', 'beginning',
